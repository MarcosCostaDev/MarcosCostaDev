# Hi There!

I am a Brazilian Software Architect & Developer. I've started my life as a developer since 2012 or so. Since then, my life has gone through different back-end, front-end and DevOps technologies.
I got a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. Also, I am recognized as MCSA and MCSD by Microsoft. I created a lot of Android, Windows Phone apps throughout my developer life. I am used to using in my server technologies C#, ASP.NET (Core/Full Framework, and probably when you are reading this .NET 5).
